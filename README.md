# Simple Server
A very simple server written in Ruby, with the [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) framework.
Designed as an endpoint to test HTTP requests against. Send a POST request to '/' and the server will echo the 
body of the request.

The name 'simple-server' was already taken on Heroku, so this app is accessible at 'send-me-stuff.herokuapp.com' instead.
